                        In software engineering, the terms front end and back end refers to the separation of concerns between the presentation layer (front end), and the data access layer (back end) of a piece of software, or the physical infrastructure or hardware. In the clientâ€“server model, the client is usually considered the front end and the server is usually considered the back end, even when some presentation work is actually done on the server.
